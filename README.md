# TheNewBoston-SpringKotlin

First steps on [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) for the server side following this [tutorial:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJcshrJOnsE&list=PL6gx4Cwl9DGDPsneZWaOFg0H2wsundyGr)

- [Spring Home](https://spring.io/)
- [JUnit 5](https://junit.org/junit5/)
- [MockMVC](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/test/web/servlet/MockMvc.html)

I don't like to have to write a lot of code before I can get in touch with any API, and for that, I always use: 
- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/)  
or
- [Boomerang](https://boomerangapi.com/)

Getting used to try first at Postman will help a lot before writing in your code

That was a beginner project using Kotlin and Spring, I hope you like it!
